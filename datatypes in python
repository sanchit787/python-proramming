‘Datatypes’ in python explain in a simple way.
1] Datatypes are the classification or categorization of knowledge items.

1] Since every value in python has a particular datatype. datatypes is nothing but a classes, and variables are object of these classes.

3] There are six datatypes which are separated in two categories.

1] mutable : which can change.
2] immutable : which can never change.
In immutable there are three types
1] numeric
e.g. : integer=10,float=10.0

2] string : string is nothing but a sequence of characters.
e.g. : “hello welcome to python”

3] tuple : tuple contains homogeneous and heterogenous values, separated by “,” in parentheses(round bracket).
e.g. : (1,2.15,”hello”)

mutable
1] list : list is datatype which contains homogeneous and heterogenous values, separated by “,” in square box.
e.g. : [1,2.15,”hello”]

2] dictionary : dictionary is datatype which contains key value pairs, separated by “,” in curly bracket.
e.g. : {“name”:”sanchit”,”age”:24,”height”:5.9}

3] Set : set is a datatype which contains unordered values in curly bracket.
e.g. : {5,2,7,11,1,5.12,”ram”}
